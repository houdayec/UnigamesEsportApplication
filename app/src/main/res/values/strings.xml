        We challenge you and your friends in your favorite games! The stake is nothing more and nothing less than glory,
        topped with awesome prizes! For the most enthusiastic gamers we offer a corner to sleep in and a spot for
        a computer in a LAN-party for the whole weekend. The grande finale is the League of Legends championship tournament,
        where the true sportsmanship is measured! There will be blood, sweat, and salt!
